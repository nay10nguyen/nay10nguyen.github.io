* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part 1, was one of the labs that I enjoyed completing since it was the first time I got to become familiar with actual coding, since this is my first computer science class I have taken. I was dealing with cin and cout statements which I thought were simple yet important. I feel that cin and cout statements were the basis for many other concepts in this class so becoming familiar with that syntax was vital for succeeding in the following labs.

* Lab 4 

    Lab 4 part 1 was a lab I enjoyed coding since it was the first time I was dealing with dates. I was able to write a code that took the difference after converting two dates to Julian Days using the Fliegel & Van Flandern's algorithm. Ultimately, this lab was very beneficial towards my learning since it taught me how to take other factors into account like the Fliegel & Van Flandern code and Gregorian dates. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 3 was another lab I enjoyed completing since this was the first game me and my partner coded. It gave me a new perspective on how to approach games since I now understand how they are created. I was able to write code that iterated through the card number values and assign the cards a score according to what card it was.
